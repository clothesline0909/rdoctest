    # This is a recursive method that takes an array of +objects+ and a desired
    # +quantity+. It returns the objects that satisy the order, or raises a
    # CantSatisyOrder exception if the order can't be completed.

    # This method relies on +objects+ being sorted by descending quantity.
    #
    # Description of algorithm:
    #
    # This algorithm finds the first object that fits into the desired quantity
    # and adds it to the order. It then calculates the remaining quantity and
    # tries to recursively satisfy an order for that sub-quantity. If the order
    # can't be satisfied for that quantity, it removes the object and tries with
    # the next largest object. If it reaches the end of the objects array and
    # none fit into the desired quantity, then it raises a CantSatisfyOrder
    # exception. The CantSatisfyOrder exception is rescued by higher levels of
    # the recursive function. When the exception is caught, the last object
    # added to the order is removed and it moves on to the next largest.

        # Skip if the object can't be added to the order.
        next if object.quantity > quantity

        # Add the object to the order.
        order << object

        # Get remaining quantity.
        remaining_quantity = quantity - get_total_quantity(order)
